%  ORPHAN
`
`  ORPHAN will limit the display to only the orphan (aka dummy/ghost)
`  members.
`
`  These are members that have no absolute generation 0 member which is
`  what happens when the member is deleted using a utility, or command,
`  that does not understand PDSE member generations.
`
`  These members are also%not`accessible using Dynamic Alloction, JCL, or
`  many other services that do not understand PDSE member generations.
